This project was done as a part of a group project for a machine learning course.

The project aims to use machine learning techniques to create three models that will aid in diagnosing COVID-19. The models will analyze X-ray images of the lungs determine whether the person has COVID-19, Non-COVID related infection or a Normal result.

The project will explore the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios like the health field.

Three types of models will be explored in this project which are a traditional machine learning model (Decision Tree), ensemble learning model (Random Forest) and a deep learning model (CNN).
